								<h3>What is a recession?</h3>
               					<p>A recession is a macroeceonomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a region, country, or the entire world that goes on for more than a few months. It shows its effect through industrial production, employment, real income, real GDP and wholesale-retail trade.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>How to identify recession?</h3>
                				<p>According to well known economists there are no certain proven ways to measure or predict Recession, but mostly if financial institutions identify decline in GDP(Grose Domestic Product) for two consecutive quarters, it can be Indicator of a recession is imminent or already taken place. Because GDP reports are generated quarterly sometimes analysts fails to identify it through GDP decline and because of that they measures other economic factors like employment, industrial production, manufacturing, market demand which can be analyse more regularly and can identify situations which can cause recession.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>What causes recession?</h3>
                				<p>There are numerous economic theories to explain why and how recession takes place. But as economists suggest every recession till date has been new of its kind, and causes of that recession were also turn out to be unique.<br><br> An overexposure of financial resources in form of credit increase or hunge investments in perticular industry can be seen as reason of recession.<br><br> Sometimes boom in perticular market creates recession when that market collapses for example when there was an dotcom bubble happened every investment banker in NewYork was investing into internet companies and it took dotcom market to skyrocket, lots of companies have got amazing IPO. But when people found out that these companies does not have reliable ways to make profits whole stock market collapsed.<br><br> Like boom wrong market assumptions are also a reason for recession for example when during 2003-04 everyone in US were buying houses on home loans. Investers, home owners and real estate agents everyone were happy and they were convinced that propety prices cannot get lower but when lots of home loan defulted Banks had huge amount of houses, lots of Houses were countinuosly being constructed which then created more supply than demand and prices got lower and suddenly whole economy collapsed and it created The Greate recession of all time in 2008.<br><br> And sometimes psychological factors can also creates recession as economists mentions when due to slow growth of stock prices or pessimism of market, Investors stops their Investment in Market, there are low incomes for Businesses, to survive they starts cost-cutting by reducing purchases and curtailing workforce which is very good step for them. But if lots of Businesses starts saving money it stops cashflow through market even more and as lots of employee are also starts saving because  risk of losing their jobs or had already lost jobs it affects local real estate market and eventually creates recession. <br><br> While sometimes new technology or international policy change can also makes whole industries obsolete and eventually can draw economy towards recession. So, there are number of ways which all are contributors of recession.<br><br> 

                				We live in capitalist society which has basic idea that everyone want to make more money or profit. But while to making more profit when some industries starts taking huge risks it creates situations in market which then causes recession. So, in my view recession is a kind of cancer for our capitalist world. We cannot ignore it. The only thing positive is, market gets better everytime and investers learns lessons and acts carefully in future. 
                				</p>
                				<h3>Understnd with an Example</h3>
                				<p>Let's consider economic problem of Surat. Surat is very popular as a center for diamond cutting and polishing, a commercial center for textiles and lots of Industries near seaport. But in Surat more than half population is invlove with either Diamond or Textile industries. Now because of such huge industrial setups for both industries, lots of small businesses in Surat are also dependent of these two, most of people are employed under either industry, most of local investments are also targeted towards either these two or real estate. So, when  International financial crisis, governmental policy change, temporary demand decrease, fluctuations in oil prices or other economical events occurs it causes recession and it ends up affecting whole city eventually. Because lots of SMEs are directly or indirectly connected with either of these industries and as both of industries have very huge setups they employee large number of labors and technitions who due to recession end up losing their jobs. Now as most of people don't have income source which then affects local retail market, real estate market. This way Surat suffers from recessions again and again.</p>
                  				<br>
                  				
                  				<h3>What can be done?</h3>
                  				<p>There are number of ways which can not stop recession from happening but can help people to servive in recession and stay healty in depression caused by recession.
								<br>
								<p>1. SMEs, retailers, wholesalers can use online fecilities to attract outside customers which can bring cashflow in Surat eventually.</p>
								<br>
								<p>2. Investers can diversify their portfolio by looking for other options like energy, securities, chemical industries, etc. so that they cannot be totally dependent on these two industries.</p>
								<br>
								<p>3. Business owners can use Business Analytics while making decisions to predict and prevent recessions from happening.</p>
								<br>
								<p>4. Government can look into this issue and can take considerable steps to help economy.</p> 
                  				</p>
                				</p>
                				<br>
                				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
                				<p>There are no specific measures for recession but we can always analyse what kind of situations create recessions and we can always take steps to prevent those situations which creates recession and can help people in time of depression. We hope this artical was useful for you.</p>
