								<h3>What is a recession?</h3>
               					<p>A recession is a macroeconomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a region, country, or the entire world that goes on for more than a few months. It shows its effect through industrial production, employment, real income, real GDP and wholesale-retail trade.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>How to identify recession?</h3>
                				<p>According to well known economists there are no certain proven ways to measure or predict Recession, but mostly if financial institutions identify decline in GDP(Gross Domestic Product) for two consecutive quarters, it can be an Indicator of a recession is imminent or already taken place. Because GDP reports are generated quarterly, sometimes analysts fails to identify it through GDP decline and because of that they measure other economic factors like employment, industrial production, manufacturing, market demand which can be analysed more regularly and can identify situations which can cause recession.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>What causes recession?</h3>
                				<p>There are numerous economic theories to explain why and how recession takes place. But as economists suggest every recession till date has been new of its kind, and causes of that recession were also turn out to be unique.<br><br> An overexposure of financial resources in form of credit increase or huge investments in particular industry can be seen as reason of recession.<br><br> Sometimes boom in particular market creates recession when that market collapses for example when there was a dotcom bubble happened every investment banker in NewYork was investing into internet companies and it took dotcom market to skyrocket, lots of companies have got amazing IPO. But when people found out that these companies do not have reliable ways to make profits whole stock market collapsed suddenly.<br><br> Like boom, wrong market assumptions are also a reason for recession for example when during 2003-04 everyone in the US were buying houses on home loans. Investors, home owners and real estate agents everyone were happy and they were convinced that property prices cannot get lower but when lots of home loan defaulted Banks had huge amount of houses, lots of Houses were continuously being constructed which then created more supply than demand and prices got lower and suddenly whole economy collapsed and it created The Great recession of all time in 2008.<br><br> And sometimes psychological factors can also creates recession as economists mentions when due to slow growth of stock prices or pessimism of market, Investors stops their Investment in Market, there are low incomes for Businesses, to survive they start cost-cutting by reducing purchases and curtailing workforce which is a very good step for them. But if lots of Businesses starts saving money it stops cash flow through market even more and as lots of employees are also starts saving because the risk of losing their jobs or had already lost jobs it affects local retail and real estate markets and eventually creates recession. <br><br> While sometimes new technology or international policy change can also makes whole industries obsolete and eventually can draw economy towards recession. So, there are a number of ways which all are contributors of recession.<br><br> 

                				We live in a capitalist world which has basic idea that everyone wants to make more money or profit. But while making more profit when some industries starts taking huge risks it creates situations in market which then causes recession. So, in my view recession is a kind of cancer for our capitalist world. We cannot ignore it. The only thing positive is, market gets better every time and investors learns lessons and acts carefully in future. 
                				</p>
                				<h3>Understnd with an Example</h3>
                				<p>Let's consider economic problem of Surat. Surat is very popular as a center for diamond cutting and polishing, a commercial center for textiles and lots of Industries near seaport. But in Surat more than half the population is involved with either Diamond or Textile industries. Now because of such huge industrial setups for both industries, lots of small businesses in Surat are also dependent of these two, most of people are employed under either industry, most of local investments are also targeted towards either these two or real estate and construction.<br><br>

                				So, when  International financial crisis, governmental policy change, temporary demand decrease, fluctuations in oil prices or other economic events occurs, which then affects diamond or textile industries. And because of the whole city is dependent on these two industries, whole city eventually end up in recession. Because lots of SMEs are directly or indirectly connected with either of these industries and as both industries have very huge setups they employee a large number of laborers and technicians. As mentioned earlier to survive in such crises businesses starts saving. So, people working in these industries lose their jobs and business to SMEs is also gets reduced. Now as most people don't have income source which then affects local retail market, real estate market. And their business also gets collapsed.</p>
                  				<br>
                  				<p>This way, a small economic change in particular industry can cause recession in the whole region.</p><br>

                  				<h3>What can be done?</h3>
                  				<p>There are a number of ways which can not stop recession from happening but can help people to survive in recession and stay healthy in depression caused by recession.
								<br>
								<p>1. SMEs, retailers, wholesalers can use <a href="https://www.starlights.xyz" >online fecilities</a> to attract outside customers which can bring money into the economy and local businesses can start showing positive growth eventually.</p>
								<br>
								<p>2. Investors can diversify their portfolio by looking for other options like energy, securities, chemical industries, etc. so that they cannot be totally dependent on these two industries.</p>
								<br>
								<p>3. Business owners can use <a href="https://www.starlights.xyz">Business Analytics</a> while making decisions to predict and prevent situations which can ignite recessions from happening.</p><p>Learn more about <u><a href="https://nopaper.in" >noPaper.in</a></u></p>.

                				</p>
                				<br>
                				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
                				<p>There are no specific measures for recession but we can always analyse what kind of situations create recessions and we can always take steps to prevent those situations which creates recession and can help people in time of depression. We hope this article was useful for you.</p>
