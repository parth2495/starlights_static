								<h3>What is a recession?</h3>
               					<p>A recession is a macroeceonomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a region, country, or the entire world that goes on for more than a few months. It is visible in industrial production, employment, real income, and wholesale-retail trade.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>How to identify recession?</h3>
                				<p>According to well known economists there are no certain proven way to measure or predict Recession, but as of generally accepted way decline in GDP(Grose Domestic Product) for two consecutive quaters is Indicator of a recession is imminent or already taken place. Apart from that economists asses several metrics to determine recession.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>What causes recession?</h3>
                				<p>There are numerous economic theories to explain why and how recession takes place. These theories can be broadly categorized as based on <b>real economic factors</b>, <b>financial factors</b>, or <b>psychological factors</b>.
								<br>
								<h3>1. Real Economic Factors</h3>
								<p>Economists belives that changes at Industries on structural level can cause recessions. For example, increase in oil prices will affects transportations, which eventually affects every industries and triggers wide spread recession.</p>	
								<br>
								<h3>2. Financial Factors</h3>
								<p>Either the overexpansion of credit and financial risk during good economic times preceding the recession, or contaction of money and credit at the onset of recessions, or both can cause recession. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarism">Monetarism</a>, is theory which blames insufficient growth in money supply which causes recession.</p>
                				<br>
                				<h3>3. Psychological Factors</h3>
                				<p>Due to excessive excitement during a preceding boom time or the deep pessimism of recessionary environment can cause recession. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics" >Keynesian economics</a> points out that once recession begins for whatever reasons, investors starts curtailing their investments based on market pessimism, which then leads to decrease incomes that decrease consumption spendings.</p> 
                				</p>
                				<h3>Understnd with an Example</h3>
                				<p>Let's consider economic problem of Surat. Surat is very popular as a center for diamond cutting and polishing, a commercial center for textiles and lots of Industries near seaport. But in Surat more than half population is invlove with either Diamond or Textile industries. Now because of such huge industrial setups for both industries, lots of small businesses in Surat are also dependent of these two, most of people are employed under either industry, most of local investments are also targeted towards either these two or real estate. So, when  International financial crisis, governmental policy change, temporary demand decrease, fluctuations in oil prices or other economical events occurs it causes recession and it ends up affecting whole city eventually. Because lots of SMEs are directly or indirectly connected with either of these industries and as both of industries have very huge setups they employee large number of labors and technitions who due to recession end up losing their jobs. Now as most of people don't have income source which then affects local retail market, real estate market. This way Surat suffers from recessions again and again.</p>
                  				<br>
                  				
                  				<h3>What can be done?</h3>
                  				<p>There are number of ways which can not stop recession from happening but can help people to servive in recession and stay healty in depression caused by recession.
								<br>
								<p>1. SMEs, retailers, wholesalers can use online fecilities to attract outside customers which can bring cashflow in Surat eventually.</p>
								<br>
								<p>2. Investers can diversify their portfolio by looking for other options like energy, securities, chemical industries, etc. so that they cannot be totally dependent on these two industries.</p>
								<br>
								<p>3. Business owners can use Business Analytics while making decisions to predict and prevent recessions from happening.</p>
								<br>
								<p>4. Government can look into this issue and can take considerable steps to help economy.</p> 
                  				</p>
                				</p>
                				<br>
                				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
                				<p>There are no specific measures for recession but we can always analyse what kind of situations create recessions and we can always take steps to prevent those situations which creates recession and can help people in time of depression. We hope this artical was useful for you.</p>
